Documentation:
 ☐ Readme - Presentation

  Protocol:

   define NodeCoin messages (data structures):
    ☐ OpenUDC certificates
    ☐ NodeCoin amendments
    ☐ NodeCoin money issuances
    ☐ NodeCoin transactions
 
Protocol implementation:

   1) Retrieving PGP certificates:
     ☐ REST service looking for OpenPGP certificates on public keyservers using HKP
     ☐ Parse Base64 response and extract PGP keyring JSON structure
     ☐ REST service to store a OpenPGP certificate Base64 encoded

   2) Managing Amendment submission:
    ☐ REST service to push root certificates used to initialize Amendment Chain
    ☐ REST service for receiving an Amendment data structure
    ☐ Check Amendment structure
    ☐ Check Amendment eligibility according to the Node rules (notably UD amount)
    ☐ Store Amendment as available for voting

   3) Voting system:
    ☐ REST service to handle voting requests
    ☐ Store valid voting requests
    ☐ According to the Node rules, chain the valid Amendment gathering enough votes
 
   4) Accepting new members:
    ☐ REST service to receive Joining Request
    ☐ According to the rules, queue the request for integration in next Amendment
 
    5) Transactions: handling issuance transactions:
     ☐ REST service for a PGP certificate to declare which Nodes manages its transactions
     ☐ REST service to process a money issuance transaction
     ☐ REST service to process a handshaked transaction
     ☐ REST service to process a forging transaction
 
   6) Non-individual PGP keys (collective keys):
    ☐ Define the OpenPGP comment format (ucid)
    ☐ Accept PGP servers declaration of Nodes managing its money
    ☐ Accept transactions fitting with this new PGP certificates format
