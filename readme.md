# NodeCoin

NodeCoin aims to be a free implementation of the OpenUDC protocol, as defined [in its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc).

## Disclaimer

NodeCoin only *aims* to be an implementation of the OpenUDC protocol, it is not. Firstly because OpenUDC protocol is still a draft, and secondly because NodeCoin have some divergences in its founding principles.
Consequentyl, NodeCoin proposes its own protocol which differs in many aspects with OpenUDC. However, we hope that those protocols will join at some point.
