# Goal of this document

If you already have a Duniter node up & running, then you might want to update it to have the latest bug fixes and evolutions. This guide is here to help you out for processing the update.

# Updating

Updating your instance is essentially equivalent to stopping your node and repeat the installation process. The existing installation just gets overriden.

So, to update you have to:

* stop your node (check the [desktop](https://forum.duniter.org/t/duniter-desktop-guide/902) or [command line](https://forum.duniter.org/t/duniter-command-line-guide/903) user's guide to know how do to it)
* follow the [installation](https://forum.duniter.org/t/install-a-duniter-node/900) guide to update your node
